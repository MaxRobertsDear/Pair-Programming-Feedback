# Pair-Programming-Feedback
Feedback for the pairing sessions throughout my time at Makers


### Michael Darmody

**Overall, how did you enjoy working with me?**

Overall I think my experience of working with you within a team was good!

**What am I doing well?**

A few things I could definitely highlight: great communication throughout the week when working and during the stand-ups, also communicating with me on a one to one level in order to explain various concepts was also great. Explanations were clear and concise throughout. 
Another thing to mention is that you remained focused and motivated throughout and contributed many times to driving the team in the right direction and providing context when needed.


**What areas can I improve to be a more effective team player?**

Having not worked with you regularly and only briefly in a team, I'm going to go off my current experience which is positive, all I can say based of the week is to continue to improve on your existing communication skills and flexibility when working with people of various skill levels to further enhance your supportive ability.

Max was an great, engaging partner to work with. His understanding of JavaScript is solid and he didn't hesitate to share his knowledge when it was needed. At points where he felt he didn't understand something, he took the time to research relevant concepts and go over them before continuing.

Max also communicated his thoughts to me clearly during the session, which not only helped me to understand his own process & vision for the steps we tackled, but it encouraged me to do the same, which ultimately led us to write better code.

While we didn't get far into the challenge, we both focused on grasping the smaller details within it, especially the module pattern. We were then able to proceed with a much more complete picture of how the various parts of the software interacted.

Overall, Max was a thorough and respectful partner, and I learned a lot from our session. I particularly appreciated the time he took to observe my own version of the application so we could understand that better as well.

Working with you was an absolute pleasure. I felt we both got a lot out of the session and deepened our understanding of JS. 
You were extremely patient and more than willing to offer assistance whilst still allowing me to learn independently. 
You were inquisitive and took the time to understand each concept instead of rushing through. 

What was really nice is that even though you were further ahead than me you didnâ€™t come across as patronising or try to rush me on at all. 

You were an excellent communicator and took the time to explain your understanding of something whilst listening to mine too. 

Thanks for a wonderful pairing sesh!
